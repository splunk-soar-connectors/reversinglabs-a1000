<h1>ReversingLabs A1000 Malware Analysis Appliance</h1>
<p>
This app supports using ReversingLabs Advanced File Analysis to 'detonate file' on the A1000 Advanced Malware Analysis Appliance.
<br/><br/>
The A1000 appliance is a powerful threat detection and file analysis platform that integrates other ReversingLabs technologies (TitaniumCore - the automated static analysis solution, and TitaniumCloud File Reputation Service) to provide detailed information on each file's status and threat capabilities.
<br/><br/>
The A1000 makes it easy to upload multiple samples for analysis. It can process, unpack, and classify them in a matter of milliseconds, and display detailed analysis reports. Historical analysis results are preserved in a database to enable in-depth searching, and malware samples are continually reanalyzed to ensure the most up-to-date file reputation status.
<br/><br/>
The A1000 relies on several threat classification methods, including YARA rules and ReversingLabs hashing algorithm (RHA) that classifies files based on their functional similarity.
<br/><br/>

</a>
<br/><br/><br/>
The "Base URL" field requires the host address of the A1000 appliance. Select the "Verify server certificate" checkbox to allow only commercial certificates, not the self-signed certificates.
<br/><br/><br/>
The "API Key" contains the authentication token obtained from an A1000 instance used for accessing the A1000 REST API.
<br/><br/><br/>
The "Detonate timeout" variable defines how long the app should wait for the results from the A1000 appliance.
